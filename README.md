## Continuous Integration/Continuos Delivery Pipeline presented by Niyi Odumosu

### What is CI/CD anyway?

CI/CD is an acronym for Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery. It is a powerful methodology of software and infrastruture development that enables engineers to develop code, commit it, and push it to a repository that triggers a delivery pipeline. 

### Why use CI/CD? 
CICD drastically increases the speed of delivering software product features that allow engineers, stakeholders, and customers alike to receive proven quality-tested results. With CICD, engineers can build and ship code to production environments in small bite size deliverables. Instead of using traditional methods that require engineers and business associates to coordinate long tiring production deployments.

### Miniproject-Odumosu-Niyi

This repository uses infrastructure as code to provision ec2 instances as well as to define a code quality tested delivery pipeline. The pipeline gets triggered by pushes to the github repository and begins to build, test and deploy the code in different environments.

Tech Stack:
 - AWS CloudFormation
 - Jenkins
 - Spring Boot
 - Docker Containers
 - Checkstyle
